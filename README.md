## What is this? ##

With `paxo` you can quickly create terminal applications with python.
It handles a bunch of stuff in the background so that you do not need to worry about it.

Why **Yet Another Command Line Library**?

Well, for me paxo is not just a command line library managing your arguments and options but also managing everything related to those commands. It generates a quick info view of your commands and also provides a help command to learn more about each command.
I hope that in the Future it will be able to handle everything documentation, manage all application configuration and data and be fully customizable so that you can create your own themes for a terminal app.
If you just want a simple library to take care for shell arguments for you there are many other options available to you.

## Installation ##

It's as simple as:

`$ pip install paxo`

## Usage ##

Paxo is really easy to use for anyone, whether you want to start quickly or customize your command line application to your own needs entirely. You can see `paxo` in action with some of my side projects. (e.g. [pen](https://github.com/cwoebker/pen) or [como](https://github.com/cwoebker/como)).
You can find a [minimalistic script](https://github.com/cwoebker/paxo) that makes use of this library inside the project's example folder:

    from paxo import Paxo
    from paxo.command import cmd


    @cmd(help='Print out a help message.')
    def hello(args):
        print 'Hello World!'

    app = Paxo('example', 'a Cecil Woebker project.', '<command>', '0.1')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.go()

A simple command line call `./example.py hello` prints “Hello World!“. Take a look at the above screenshot for the accompanying info screen of the example.py command.
